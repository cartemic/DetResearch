Viewing Section

The viewing section is made from a large, monolithic piece of steel. It was lovingly crafted by `Black Mountain Manufacturing <https://blackmountainmfg.com/>`_. It is expensive and hard to manufacture. Do not break it.

Windows
=======

Quartz
------

:download:`Drawing <drawings/viewing_section/Window.pdf>`

Windows are waterjet cut from fused quartz, and are currently purchased from `Machined Glass Specialists <https://mgsfusedquartz.com/>`_. In the past, windows have been ordered from `GM Associates <https://gm-quartz.com/>`_.

To replace a window:

1. Remove the window.

   * Use a suction cup if possible.

   * If the window is too broken for a suction cup, remove the top window blank and push the window out from the inside. Smashing the window in is also an option, but the cleanup process kind of sucks.

2. Radius the chamfered corners using a 60 grit sanding wheel on the belt sander.

   *  At one point I ordered these with a radius instead of a chamfer, but they broke way faster so I've taken to doing the radius myself with good results.

3. Place two rubber bands around the perimeter of the window and secure them with masking tape to keep them from rolling.

   * The rubber bands you get wrapped around a carton of eggs at WINCO are perfect for this.

   * The purpose of the rubber bands is to isolate the quartz from the metal; without them the windows break very quickly (after ~1-2 shots).

4. `Install the window seal <#seal>`_.

5. Make sure the window is clean and dry, and insert it into the viewing section.

6. Insert a window `shim <#shim>`_ with the rubber side facing the window.

7. Install the `window retainer <#window-retainers>`_.

8. Leak check the tube.


Steel Blank

These are used to allow the tube to be run without windows, and were included as part of the tube fabrication from [Black Mountain Manufacturing](https://blackmountainmfg.com/), and are installed in the same manner as [quartz windows](#quartz).

Seal
----

:download:`Drawing <drawings/viewing_section/Window_Seal.pdf>`

Window seals are made from 1/8" thick Buna-N rubber with 50A durometer (Grainger part no. `1XYH7 <https://www.grainger.com/product/E-JAMES-Rubber-Sheet-1XYH7>`_ or McMaster part no. `8635K814 <https://www.mcmaster.com/8635K814/>`_). To replace this part:

1. Clean dust off the rubber sheet. This makes the sharpie happy.

2. Trace a window shim on a section of the rubber using a sharpie.

3. Cut the traced seal using scissors or a box cutter.

4. Attach double-sided tape to one side of the seal and trim it down. This will keep the seal from bowing inward, particularly in the vertical sections. With a fresh seal this is less of a problem, but reused seals tend to bow in significantly. This has a very small effect on the schlieren system, but has the potential to cause sealing problems.

Budget allowing, it would be great to get a bunch of these waterjet cut instead.

Shim
----

Due to a design error it is necessary to add shims between the window retainers and the windows. The original design included a seal on either side of the window; unfortunately, the outer seal did not also seal off the screw holes, and when the pressure within the tube increased enough, the outer seal compressed, relieving the inner seal, and allowing the tube to leak. The shims are here to rectify this problem. The shims consist of metal frames with a thin layer of rubber to protect the quartz.

Metal
^^^^^

These were waterjet cut out of 12 gauge stainless sheet by `Viper Northwest <https://www.vipernorthwest.com/>`_.

Rubber
^^^^^^

A very thin layer of red silicone (McMaster part no. `3635K83 <https://www.mcmaster.com/3635K83/>`_) is attached to the side of the shim that touches the window. Its sole function is to protect the window, and **it is not a seal**.

To replace the shim rubber:

1. Cut out a section of rubber that is roughly the dimensions of the window. The shim, an old window, or one of the steel window blanks provide handy templates to use.

2. Stick the adhesive side to the shim.

3. Trim the rubber to the shim using a razor blade.

Window Retainers
================

:download:`Drawing <drawings/viewing_section/Window_Retainer.pdf>`

To install a window retainer:

1. Install the `window <#quartz>`_ or `blank <#steel-blank>`_.

2. Ensure the `screws <#screws>`_ have sufficient `anti-seize <https://www.amazon.com/Permatex-81343-Anti-Seize-Lubricant-Tube/dp/B0002UEOLO>`_ compound on their threads.

3. Hand tighten the screws using the bolt pattern shown below.

4. Using a ratchet, incrementally tighten the screws using the bolt pattern until the seal is compressed and the retainer is flush with the viewing section.

5. Torque the screws to 10 foot-pounds following the bolt pattern.

6. Repeat step 4 until the torque wrench clicks on all 20 screws in a row with no further tightening.

Screws
======

Each viewing window retainer requires 20 1/4-28 grade 8 hex head screws (such as McMaster part no `91257A565 <https://www.mcmaster.com/91257A565/>`_). Each screw should have standard 1/4 inch washer between its head and the window retainer.
